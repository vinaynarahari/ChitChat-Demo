# GroupReadReceipts Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The "test" user was showing as "caught up" in the GroupReadReceipts component even though they had NOT read any messages in the group chat. This was causing incorrect read receipt displays.

## Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ What Was Working Correctly
1. **MongoDB Data**: The database correctly showed that "test" user had NOT read any messages
2. **Component Logic**: The GroupReadReceipts component logic was correct
3. **Backend Logic**: The read receipt calculation was working properly

### ❌ The Actual Issue
**Stale cached data in Redis** was being served to the frontend, causing the GroupReadReceipts component to display outdated `readBy` information.

## Technical Details

### The Problem
- API endpoint `/api/messages/:groupChatId` was caching responses for 30 seconds
- Cache key: `messages:${groupChatId}:${page}:${limit}:${userId}`
- When users marked messages as read, the cache for ALL users became stale
- The `readBy` field in cached responses was outdated
- GroupReadReceipts component was making decisions based on stale data

### Evidence
```bash
# MongoDB shows correct data:
- Test user has read: false
- Expected UI: test should see 2 caught up (nara, Sahil Kumar)
- Actual UI: test was showing as caught up (incorrect)
```

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Cache Invalidation (`server/index.js`)
```javascript
// Before: Only cleared `messages:${groupId}:*`
// After: Aggressive clearing of all related patterns
const patterns = [
  `messages:${groupId}:*`,           // Main message cache
  `groupChat:${groupId}:*`,          // Group chat cache  
  `voiceMeta:*`,                     // Voice metadata cache
  `user:*:messages:*`                // User-specific message cache
];
```

### 2. Reduced Cache TTL with Freshness Checking
```javascript
// Before: 30 second cache, always used if available
// After: 15 second cache with 10 second freshness check
if (cacheAge < 10) { // Only use cache if less than 10 seconds old
  return res.json(cachedResponse.messages);
} else {
  await redisClient.del(cacheKey); // Clear stale cache
}
```

### 3. Force Refresh on Read Receipt Updates (`GroupChatContext.tsx`)
```javascript
// Added: Force fresh fetch when read receipts are updated
if (selectedChat?._id) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    fetchMessages(selectedChat._id, true); // Force fresh fetch
  }, 100);
}
```

### 4. Improved Socket-Based Cache Invalidation
- Enhanced the `invalidateMessageCache` function in socket handlers
- Clears cache immediately when messages are read
- Ensures all users get fresh data after read receipt updates

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
- MongoDB: test user has NOT read messages ✅
- Frontend: test user showing as caught up ❌
- Issue: Stale cached data
```

### After Fix
```
- MongoDB: test user has NOT read messages ✅  
- Frontend: test user should NOT show as caught up ✅
- Cache: Fresh data served within 10 seconds ✅
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Restart Node.js Server**: Apply cache improvements
2. **Restart React Native App**: Clear AsyncStorage cache
3. **Test GroupReadReceipts**: Verify correct behavior
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check for cache invalidation messages

## Prevention

The implemented fixes prevent this issue by:
- **Aggressive cache clearing** when read receipts change
- **Short cache TTL** with freshness validation
- **Force refresh** on socket events
- **Multiple invalidation patterns** to catch all cached data

## Files Modified

1. `server/index.js` - Enhanced cache invalidation and TTL
2. `app/context/GroupChatContext.tsx` - Added force refresh on read receipt updates
3. `scripts/force-cache-clear.js` - Verification and testing script

## Expected Behavior

After the fix, each user should see:
- **nara**: 1 caught up (Sahil Kumar)
- **Sahil Kumar**: 1 caught up (nara)  
- **test**: 2 caught up (nara, Sahil Kumar)

The "test" user should **NOT** appear as caught up to anyone since they haven't read the messages.
