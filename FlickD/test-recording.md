# Recording Functionality Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **"Recorder does not exist" error**: Added proper state checking and cleanup before starting new recordings
2. **"Cannot unload a Recording that has already been unloaded" error**: Added status checking before cleanup operations
3. **Component unmounting while recording**: Added safe cleanup functions and better error handling

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the recording process
- Each function now has clear log prefixes for easier debugging
- Status updates are logged to track recording state

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around all recording operations
- Graceful handling of cleanup errors
- State reset on errors to prevent stuck states

### 3. Safe Cleanup Functions
- `safeRecordingCleanup()`: Safely handles recording cleanup with status checking
- `cleanupAudio()`: Enhanced to handle recording state properly
- Component unmount cleanup: Ensures recording is cleaned up when leaving

### 4. State Management
- Better synchronization between recording states
- Proper cleanup of recording references
- Prevention of race conditions

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Recording Test
1. Open a group chat
2. Tap the record button
3. Verify recording starts (check logs for "Recording started successfully")
4. Tap stop to end recording
5. Verify transcription process starts

### 2. Recording Cancellation Test
1. Start recording
2. Navigate away from chat (back button)
3. Verify recording is cancelled and file is deleted
4. Check logs for cleanup messages

### 3. Chat Switching Test
1. Start recording in one chat
2. Switch to another chat
3. Verify recording is cancelled properly
4. Check that no errors appear in logs

### 4. Component Unmount Test
1. Start recording
2. Close the app or navigate away
3. Verify no "Recorder does not exist" errors
4. Check logs for proper cleanup

## Expected Log Messages

### Successful Recording Start
```
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Starting recording process...
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Setting audio mode...
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Creating new recording instance...
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Preparing recording...
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Starting recording...
[GCTestDatabase][startRecording] Recording started successfully
```

### Successful Recording Stop
```
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Stopping recording...
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Stopping and unloading recording...
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Recording URI: file://...
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Starting transcription process...
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Transcription completed, fetching messages...
[GCTestDatabase][stopRecording] Cleaning up recording state...
```

### Safe Cleanup
```
[GCTestDatabase][safeRecordingCleanup] Starting safe recording cleanup...
[GCTestDatabase][safeRecordingCleanup] Recording status: { isRecording: true }
[GCTestDatabase][safeRecordingCleanup] Recording is active, stopping...
[GCTestDatabase][safeRecordingCleanup] Recording stopped successfully
[GCTestDatabase][safeRecordingCleanup] Resetting recording state...
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Check the logs** - Look for the detailed log messages to identify where the issue occurs
2. **Verify audio permissions** - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
3. **Check device audio settings** - Ensure the device isn't muted or in silent mode
4. **Restart the app** - Sometimes a fresh start helps clear any stuck states

### Common Issues:

1. **"Recorder does not exist"**: This should now be prevented by proper state checking
2. **"Cannot unload" errors**: These should be prevented by status checking before cleanup
3. **Component unmount errors**: These should be handled by the safe cleanup functions

## Performance Notes

- The enhanced logging will help identify any performance issues
- Recording cleanup is now more robust and should prevent memory leaks
- State management improvements should reduce unnecessary re-renders
