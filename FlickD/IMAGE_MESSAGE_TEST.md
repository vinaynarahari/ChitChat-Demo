# Image Message Support - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Message Interface
- Added `mediaUrl?: string` field to `Message` interface in both:
  - `app/context/GroupChatContext.tsx`
  - `app/types.ts`

### 2. Enhanced GroupChatMessage Component
- Updated `precomputeMessageData` function to handle image and video message types
- Added `isImageMessage` and `isVideoMessage` flags
- Updated `renderMedia` function to render images and videos
- Updated text content rendering to show text for image/video messages
- Updated React.memo comparison to include mediaUrl changes
- Updated useMemo dependencies to include mediaUrl

### 3. Image Rendering Logic
- Images are rendered using React Native's `Image` component
- Videos are rendered using Expo's `Video` component
- Both use existing `mediaContainer` and `mediaContent` styles
- Images use `resizeMode="cover"` for proper aspect ratio

### 4. Fixed Double Upload Issue (CRITICAL FIX)
- **Problem**: Image messages were being uploaded twice:
  1. First upload: `uploadMediaToS3()` - Uploads file to S3
  2. Second upload: `uploadGroupMedia()` - Saves reference to MongoDB newspaperMedia collection
- **Solution**: Removed the redundant `uploadGroupMedia()` call from `RecordingControls.tsx`
- **Result**: Image messages now upload only once and display correctly without media preview errors

### 5. Fixed Audio Playback System for Image/Video Messages (CRITICAL FIX)
- **Problem**: The system was trying to get audio URLs for image/video messages, causing errors
- **Solution**: Updated multiple functions to properly handle image/video messages:

#### 5.1 Updated `getAudioUrl` function
- Added check for `message.type === 'image' || message.type === 'video'`
- Returns appropriate error message instead of trying to get audio URL
- Preserves all existing functionality for voice and text messages

#### 5.2 Updated `addToRobustQueue` function
- Prevents image/video messages from being added to audio playback queue
- Marks image/video messages as processed and viewed
- Returns `false` to indicate message was not added to queue

#### 5.3 Updated `processRobustQueue` function
- Skips image/video messages during queue processing
- Marks image/video messages as viewed and removes from queue
- Continues processing next message in queue

#### 5.4 Updated `playMessage` function
- Checks message type before attempting to get audio URL
- Handles image/video messages by marking them as viewed
- Prevents audio playback attempts for non-audio messages

## How It Works

1. **Server Side**: Image messages are saved with `mediaUrl` field pointing to S3 URL
2. **Client Side**: When a message has `type: 'image'` and `mediaUrl`, it renders as an image
3. **Text Support**: Image messages can also have text content that displays below the image
4. **Video Support**: Video messages are also supported with the same pattern
5. **Audio Playback**: Image/video messages are completely excluded from the audio playback system

## Testing

To test image message functionality:

1. Send an image message through the app
2. Verify the image displays in the chat
3. Verify text content (if any) displays below the image
4. Verify the message appears correctly for all users in the chat
5. Verify no "media preview error" occurs
6. Verify image messages are not added to audio playback queue
7. Verify image messages are marked as viewed when received

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing voice and text messages continue to work exactly as before
- The `mediaUrl` field is optional, so existing messages without it are unaffected
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Audio playback system remains unchanged for voice messages

## Files Modified

1. `app/context/GroupChatContext.tsx` - Added mediaUrl to Message interface
2. `app/types.ts` - Added mediaUrl to Message interface  
3. `app/components/GroupChatMessage.tsx` - Enhanced rendering for image/video messages
4. `components/RecordingControls.tsx` - Fixed double upload issue by removing redundant uploadGroupMedia call
5. `app/gcTestDatabase.tsx` - Fixed test data and updated audio playback system to handle image/video messages

## Fix Summary

The main issues were:
1. **Double upload**: Fixed by removing redundant `uploadGroupMedia()` call
2. **Audio URL errors**: Fixed by updating `getAudioUrl()` to check message type
3. **Queue processing errors**: Fixed by preventing image/video messages from entering audio queue
4. **Playback errors**: Fixed by updating `playMessage()` to handle non-audio messages

Now images upload once, display correctly, and are properly excluded from the audio playback system while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Next Steps

The image message functionality is now implemented and should work with the existing backend that saves image messages with mediaUrl. Users should now be able to see image messages in chats instead of empty messages.
