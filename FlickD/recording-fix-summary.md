# Simple Recording State Fix

## Problem Identified from Logs

The logs revealed **multiple simultaneous recording instances** causing:
1. **"Recorder is already prepared"** - Multiple instances trying to prepare
2. **"Recorder does not exist"** - Trying to stop already cleaned up recording  
3. **"Cannot unload a Recording that has already been unloaded"** - Double cleanup attempts

## Root Cause
- **Race conditions** between auto-recording and manual recording triggers
- **Multiple recording instances** being created simultaneously
- **No state synchronization** between recording operations

## Simple Solution Implemented

### 1. Recording State Lock
```typescript
const recordingLockRef = useRef(false);
```
- Prevents multiple simultaneous recording operations
- Ensures only one recording operation can be active at a time

### 2. Debounce Mechanism
```typescript
const canStartRecording = () => {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - lastRecordingAttemptRef.current < 500) {
    return false; // Debounced
  }
  lastRecordingAttemptRef.current = now;
  return true;
};
```
- Prevents rapid successive recording attempts
- 500ms debounce window

### 3. Enhanced State Checking
- All recording functions now check both `recordingLockRef.current` and `isRecording`
- Prevents operations when recording is already in progress
- Ensures proper cleanup in all scenarios

## Key Changes Made

### `startRecording()`
- ✅ Checks debounce first
- ✅ Checks recording lock and state
- ✅ Sets lock before starting
- ✅ Releases lock in finally block

### `stopRecording()`
- ✅ Checks recording lock before stopping
- ✅ Prevents multiple stop attempts
- ✅ Proper state cleanup

### `safeRecordingCleanup()`
- ✅ Uses recording lock to prevent conflicts
- ✅ Safe cleanup without affecting active operations

### `cleanupAudio()`
- ✅ Simplified to avoid recording conflicts
- ✅ Only cleans up audio playback, not recording

## Benefits

1. **No More Race Conditions** - Recording lock prevents simultaneous operations
2. **No More Double Cleanup** - State checking prevents duplicate operations  
3. **No More "Recorder does not exist"** - Proper state management
4. **No More "Cannot unload"** - Safe cleanup procedures
5. **Minimal Code Changes** - Only affects recording state management
6. **No Feature Impact** - All other functionality remains unchanged

## Testing

The fix addresses the exact issues shown in the logs:
- ✅ Prevents "Recorder is already prepared" errors
- ✅ Prevents "Recorder does not exist" errors  
- ✅ Prevents "Cannot unload" errors
- ✅ Handles component unmounting properly
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Single Recording Instance** - Only one recording can be active at a time
2. **Proper Cleanup** - Recording state is properly managed
3. **No Errors** - All the previous errors should be eliminated
4. **Smooth Operation** - Recording starts/stops work reliably

This simple fix addresses the core state management issues without affecting any other features of the codebase. 

# Recording and Audio Playback Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auto-Recording Happening Multiple Times
**Problem**: The `hasAutoRecordedRef.current` flag was being reset in multiple places, allowing auto-recording to happen again when it should only happen once per chat session.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Proper flag management**: Only reset `hasAutoRecordedRef.current` when changing chats, not after recording completion
- ✅ **Enhanced conditions**: Added checks for `justFinishedRecordingRef.current` to prevent immediate re-recording
- ✅ **Better logging**: Added detailed logging to track when auto-recording is skipped and why
- ✅ **Improved state management**: Prevented conflicts between manual and auto-recording

### 2. "Unsupported URL" Audio Playback Errors
**Problem**: Audio URLs from S3 were sometimes malformed or invalid, causing Expo's Audio API to throw "unsupported URL" errors.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **URL validation**: Added comprehensive URL format validation in `getAudioUrl()` and `getSignedAudioUrl()`
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Specific error messages for different types of URL issues
- ✅ **Retry logic**: Implemented retry mechanism for getting audio URLs
- ✅ **Timeout handling**: Added 10-second timeout for audio loading
- ✅ **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging information for URL generation and validation

### 3. Auto-Recording During Message Playback
**Problem**: Auto-recording was starting while unread messages were actively playing, causing conflicts.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Enhanced playback state checking**: Added `!isPlayingMessage` condition to prevent auto-recording while messages are playing
- ✅ **Recording interruption**: Stop any existing recording before starting to play unread messages
- ✅ **Better state synchronization**: Improved coordination between playback and recording states
- ✅ **Detailed logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track playback and recording states

### 4. Only Playing Oldest Unread Message
**Problem**: The system was only playing the first unread message instead of all unread messages sequentially.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Sequential playback**: Modified `onPlaybackStatusUpdate` to find and play ALL remaining unread messages
- ✅ **Message type handling**: Properly handle voice, image, and video messages
- ✅ **Continuous playback**: Ensure the next message starts playing immediately after the current one finishes
- ✅ **Comprehensive tracking**: Track all unread messages and ensure none are missed

### 5. Messages Being Marked as Read on Chat Open
**Problem**: Messages were being marked as read immediately when opening a chat, preventing the unread message playback system from working.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Removed mark-all-read on chat open**: Modified `selectGroupChat` to NOT call the mark-all-read endpoint
- ✅ **Individual read marking**: Messages are now marked as read only when they are actually played/viewed
- ✅ **Preserved unread state**: Unread messages remain unread until they are actually consumed
- ✅ **Real-time read receipts**: Messages are marked as read when playback starts for proper read receipt handling

### 6. Real-Time Messages Not Being Played
**Problem**: When both users are in the chat and messages are sent, they weren't being auto-played even though they were instantly viewed.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Real-time message handling**: Added useEffect to detect new unread messages and trigger playback
- ✅ **Socket message integration**: Enhanced socket message handling to trigger unread message playback
- ✅ **Immediate playback trigger**: New messages trigger the playback system immediately when received
- ✅ **Proper state management**: Ensure real-time messages are properly integrated with the existing playback system

## Key Changes Made

### Real-Time Message Test:
1. Have both users in the same chat
2. Send voice messages from one user
3. Verify messages auto-play for the other user
4. Check read receipts are sent properly

## Troubleshooting

### If auto-recording still happens multiple times:
1. Check logs for "Skipping auto-recording due to conditions"
2. Verify `hasAutoRecordedRef.current` is being set correctly
3. Check if `justFinishedRecordingRef.current` is working
4. Ensure `isPlayingMessage` is properly set during playback

### If audio playback still fails:
1. Check logs for URL validation errors
2. Verify S3 bucket permissions and configuration
3. Test network connectivity
4. Check if audio files are properly uploaded to S3

### If not all messages are playing:
1. Check logs for "Remaining unread messages"
2. Verify `playedMessageIdsRef.current` is being updated correctly
3. Check if message types are being handled properly
4. Ensure the playback chain is not being interrupted

### If messages are still being marked as read on open:
1. Check that `selectGroupChat` is not calling mark-all-read
2. Verify messages remain unread until played
3. Check read receipt timing in logs
4. Ensure individual read marking is working

### If real-time messages aren't playing:
1. Check socket connection status
