# Recording Fixes Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Only one Recording object can be prepared at a given time" Error

**Problem**: Multiple simultaneous calls to `prepareToRecordAsync()` were causing conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- Added processing state protection in `RecordingService`
- Added 100ms delay before preparation to prevent race conditions
- Better cleanup of existing recording objects
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

**Test Steps**:
1. Start recording quickly multiple times
2. Check logs for "Recording conflict - another recording is active" instead of crashes
3. Verify recording works properly after conflicts are resolved

### 2. Auto-Recording Queue Integration

**Problem**: Auto-recording was bypassing the queue system, causing conflicts in group chats.

**Solution**:
- Modified `triggerAutoRecording()` to check for queue system usage
- Auto-recording users are now added to the queue when someone else is recording
- Added `isAutoRecording` flag to distinguish auto vs manual queue joins
- Integrated with existing queue management system

**Test Steps**:
1. Enable auto-recording in a group chat with 3+ members
2. Have one user start recording manually
3. Send a message to trigger auto-recording for another user
4. Verify the auto-recording user is added to the queue instead of conflicting
5. Check that auto-recording starts when their turn comes in the queue

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "Only one Recording object can be prepared at a given time" errors
- ❌ Auto-recording conflicts with manual recording
- ❌ Recording state inconsistencies

### After Fix:
- ✅ Clean recording error handling
- ✅ Auto-recording integrates with queue system
- ✅ No recording conflicts in group chats
- ✅ Proper state management

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check logs for recording conflicts (should be handled gracefully)
grep -n "Recording conflict" logs/app.log

# Check for auto-recording queue integration
grep -n "Adding auto-recording user to queue" logs/app.log

# Verify no more "Only one Recording object" errors
grep -n "Only one Recording object" logs/app.log
```

## Test Scenarios

1. **Rapid Recording Attempts**: Tap record button multiple times quickly
2. **Auto-Record in Busy Group**: Multiple users with auto-recording enabled
3. **Queue Integration**: Auto-recording while someone else is recording
4. **Error Recovery**: Recording after errors should work properly

## Success Criteria

- No "Only one Recording object" errors in logs
- Auto-recording users appear in queue when appropriate
- Recording works consistently after conflicts
- Queue system handles both manual and auto-recording users
